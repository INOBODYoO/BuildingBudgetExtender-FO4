What does the mod do?
---------------------
To put it simple, the mod removes/extends the limit of how many objects one can place in Fallout 4’s settlements, surpassing the limit established by Bethesda.

Is is safe to use?
Well yes, however take it with a grain of salt.
Bethesda established a limit for a reason, that being, going way beyond that limit at some point in time the player may start having performance issues, like lag and visual glitches. The limit is also there and balanced for the average player systems, where low-end systems can play the game in a some what stable performance, and mid to high end systems can play the game with ease.
Surpassing the limit doesn’t affect performance immediately, however, the real limit then will be in fact your system and how well it will handle the game as you play. If you’re playing at a low-end system perhaps its not recommended to use this mod, but above that you should be good enough.

But aren’t there other mods that do the same?
---------------------
Technically there are yes.
However the majority of these mods make you download a text/bat file and run a certain command in the game console for each and every settlement to increase their budget, but this is very inefficient.
This mod does it all for you automatically requiring you to only install it and nothing more.

How does it work?
---------------------
Its quite simple actually, the mod runs an unique and independent script, and as soon the the player enters the Workshop Mode of a settlement the mod changes the values of WorkshopMaxTriangles and WorkshopMaxDraws variables to surpass their default values.

Note: Take in mind the first time you enter a settlement in Workshop Mode with this mod, its required that the player re-enters Workshop Mode, and this is done automatically, by forcing the player to exit and enter the Mode again, therefore do not panic when the flickering happens.
